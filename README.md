# Roblox followers remover
### A simple python script allowing Roblox users to automate the process of removing account followers(by blocking and unblocking them). The script also provides the option of only removing botted followers. This project was created with the purpose of helping Roblox developers quickly remove botted followers from their accounts if they wish to do so.
